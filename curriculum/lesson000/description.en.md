**This program is totally suitable for absolute beginners :-)**

Programming is the literacy of the future. Not knowing how to program will be like being not able to read & write in todays world.
In order to not be left behind and to have nice opportunities in your future, it is really important to add this skill to your existing skill set.
There are many languages you can learn, but in the past years, JavaScript is becoming the English of programming languages.
With it, you can build web pages, mobile apps, desktop apps, control drones, do virtual reality, data analysis and much more.
It is very universal and it is growing in popularity.

### First Lesson
Here we set you up with all the requirements, which means:
* `EMAIL` - If you don't have an email account yet, create a gmail account
* `BROWSER` - If you don't have the chrome browser yet, download & install it and singup for a chrome profile
  * allows easy cross device synchronization of your personal browser configuration
  * has amazing chrome developer tools to help you build awesome software
* `GITHUB` - You will get to know the most important social network for programmers
* `GITTER` - join the open chat platform, download the app and join our wizard amigos community chat
  * Please introduce yourself and feel free to ask any questions. Our community is more than happy to help :-)

### What's next?
#### 1. Next you learn the alphabet of JavaScript (syntax, grammar,...)
Because this is pure theory that needs repetition to be memorized, we figured out, the best way is to use CodeCombat, a game that helps you learn the syntax without making it too dry and boring. This way you repeat things and in between you will find videos with theory summaries of what you have learned so far, so keep watching videos.

#### 2. Then you build your first profile webpage with a portfolio section
You build your first portfolio web page and learn how to
* retrieve data from a database
* do simple animations

#### 3. Then we continue with building your first web app (a quiz)
This is your first portfolio item and we recommend you play and customize it a bit and don't just copy the tutorial instructions. We explain you all the details about how to do that.

#### 4. Finally we learn how to transform this quiz into a mobile app.
So you can upload it to the android play store or apple store for other users to download.
