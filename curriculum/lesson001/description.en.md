### How to manage your growing knowledge during this journey?
You will learn about two tools and a very simple but essential technique,
to remeber things you already learned during your journey and access them when you need them.
1. **`BOOKMARKS`** enable you to save important links into folders for quick access
  * The `bookmark manager` also allows you to `search` your growing knowledge base
2. **`GISTS`** allow you to `make & edit` personal custom notes that you can share & discuss with other developers
  * bookmarking `gists` next to other links in your bookmark folders can add more context

The browsers **bookmark bar** always gives you quick access to what you learned so far,
so that you can lookup details and code snippets when you need them.

### THE GOAL
Try to slowly improve and refine your bookmarks and bookmark folder structure.
* **`remove`** links from your bookmarks once you feel they are outdated
* **`edit or delete`** custom gist notes to reflect your current knowledge
* **`restructure`** your bookmark folders to become the high-level overview over your knowledge

Always try to go for **quality** over **quantity**. If you regularly remove outdated links and notes
and update your high-level overview by re-arranging your bookmark folders accordingly, you
are well equipped to advance fast :-)
