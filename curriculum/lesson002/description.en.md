In this lesson, you will create an avatar or upload a picture of yourself and fill out your github profile with some more information. Then you will improve your typing skills and test them. You should at least be able to type ~30 words per minute.

Once you are comfortable, please introduce yourself in the chat. Community is always happy to welcome new wizards :-)

You will also get to know some more useful tools you can add to your bookmark bar.
If you know some more cool tools or stumble upon them - please feel free to share them with the wizardamigos community.
