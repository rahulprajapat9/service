In this lesson, we encourage you to fill out your github profile with some more information
and create an avatar or upload a picture of yourself. Then we show you how you can improve your
keyboard typing skills and test them. You should at least be able to type ~30 words per minute.

Once you are comfortable, please introduce yourself in the chat. We are always happy to welcome new wizards :-)

We also present some basic tools that can proof to be useful on your journey and add them to your bookmark bar.
If you know some more cool tools or stumble upon them - please feel free to share them with the wizardamigos community :-)
